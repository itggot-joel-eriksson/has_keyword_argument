# put_to_bed

### Task description

The world has been taken over by robots.

They need your help to create a function they can use to say goodnight to the world's children.

Create en function `put_to_bed` that recieves a name (`name:`) **as an argument** and **returns** "*Nighty nighty, {name}!*"

### Flowchart

Before you start coding you should create a flowchart for the program.

Test the flowchart using a pen (or a pencil) and paper.

### Example

```ruby
	puts put_to_bed(name: 'Billy-Bob')
    #=> 'Nighty nighty, Billy-Bob!'
```

### Tests

The tests are located in `test/test_put_to_bed.rb`

Run the tests (from the project root): `ruby test/test_put_to_bed.rb`

### Bonuslevel

What happens if you send an empty `String` as the argument?

Update the program so that it handles improper input.
